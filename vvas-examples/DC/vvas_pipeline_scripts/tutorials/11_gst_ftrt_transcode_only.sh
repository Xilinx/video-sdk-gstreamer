# This script accepts an 8-bit, YUV420, pre-encoded h264 file and will send the encoded h.264 output to /tmp/xil_ftrt_xcode.mp4 at a rate of 8Mbps.
# This use case is optimized for "faster than realtime"; that is, processing a whole clip faster than the human eye would watch it.

# You may edit this to enable other output bitrates (target-bitrate and max-bitrate).

# You may change the target codecs to HEVC by changing:
#     the first  instance of (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) for decoding from HEVC
#     the second instance of (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264) to (-c:v mpsoc_vcu_hevc) for encoding into HEVC

# The -slices flag has implications on visual quality, while the -cores flag does not.
# Refer to the online documentation and to the visual quality examples for more details.
