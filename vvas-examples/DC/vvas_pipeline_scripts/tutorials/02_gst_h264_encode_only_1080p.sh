# pre-requisite to run this script: source /opt/xilinx/vvas/setup.sh
# This script accepts an 8-bit and 10bit, YUV420, 1080p60 RAW nv12 file and will send the encoded h.264 output to 
# /tmp/xil_enc_out*.mp4 at a rate of 8Mbps using filesink option
# This script also has the option to display the max possible fps values if fakesink=1 as argument. Default value is 0
# This script also supports running multiple instances of same pipeline based on resolution of input stream

#You may edit this to accept other resolution (width, height), other framerate , other output bitrates (target-bitrate).
#You may also use /dev/null inplace of file output path.

# You may change the target codec to HEVC by changing:
#     the h264parse plugin to h265parse plugin, video/x-raw property for encoding into HEVC
